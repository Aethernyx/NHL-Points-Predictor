# NHL-Points-Predictor
In this python file, I have created a multiple linear regression to predict 2019-2020 NHL team points based off past team data in the 2019-2020 season.

The model predicts points based off of wins, goals for, and goals against.


I have also created a call for user input to allow a user to input wins, goals for, and goals against in order to obtain a predicted amount of points.
